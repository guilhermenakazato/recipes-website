            "Nega Maluca Cake is a traditional Brazilian chocolate cake that is
            covered with a chocolate sauce ORRR with some sweet brigadeiro. It’s
            seriously the world’s easiest cake to make and possibly one of the
            most delicious too!"

        <li>
          <span>4</span>
          <p>
            In a large bowl, mix in the oil and sugar, using a hand mixer, in
            medium speed (you can also mix by hand)
          </p>

        <li>
          <span>6</span>
          <p>
            Then, add 1/3 of the dry ingredients mixture to the eggs mixture,
            and fold by hand with a spatula to combine. Add half of the water,
            and fold to combine. Add the second third of the dry ingredients,
            and fold to combine. Add the last of the water, and fold to combine.
            Add the last third of the dry ingredients, and fold to combine.

        <li>
          <span>7</span>
          <p>
            Pour the batter into the greased pan, and bake until a cake
            tester/toothpick inserted to the middle comes out lightly crumbly to
            clean (about 35-40 mins)
          </p>

        <li>
          <span>8</span>
          <p>
            Move the cake pan to a cooling rack and let it cool for about 10
            mins, then remove the cake from the pan and let it cool in the rack

          <p>
            Add the condensed milk and the chocolate powder to a nonstick sauce
            pan and stir over medium to high heat, then keep stirring for about
            10 minutes, scraping the sides of the pan with a rubber spatula or
            wooden spoon to avoid burning. Cook until the mixture reaches
            185F-195F – You can use a candy thermometer, or just a regular food
            thermometer to check.
